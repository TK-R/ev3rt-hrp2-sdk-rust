 **	ABSTRUCT   : Two wheeled self-balancing robot "NXTway-GS" balance control program.
 **              NXTway-GS balance control algorithum is based on modern control theory
 **              which is servo control (state + integral feedback).
 **              To develop the controller and indentify the plant, The MathWorks
 **              MATLAB&Simulink had been used and this design methodology is
 **              called MBD (Model-Based Design/Development). This C source code
 **              is automatically generated from a Simulink model by using standard features
 **              of Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder. All control parameters need to be defined
 **              by user and the sample parameters are defined in nxtOSEK\samples\nxtway_gs\balancer_param.c.
 **              For more detailed information about the controller alogorithum, please check:

// FUNCTION    : balance_control
// PARAMETERS  :
//   (float)args_cmd_forward : forward/backward command. 100(max. forward) to -100(max. backward)
//   (float)args_cmd_turn    : turn command. 100(right max.turn) to -100(left max. turn)
//   (float)args_gyro        : gyro sensor data

// DESCRIPTION : NXTway-GS balance control function
//               This function must be invoked in 4msec period.
//               Gyro sensor offset data is varied depending on a product and it has drift
//               while it's turned on, so these things need to be considered.
//               Left & right motor revolutions may be different even if a same PWM output is
//               given, in this case, user needs to add some motor revolution compensator.
